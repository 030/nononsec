# NoNonSec — No-nonsense Security

## Overview

**NoNonSec** delivers the hard truth:  
**No-nonsense Security** — no shortcuts, no excuses, no endless discussions.

Only run software you can fully trust.  
Trust is earned; it must never be assumed.

No endless debates about vague reasons like “it only runs internally” or
“other excuses.” Security applies everywhere, no exceptions.

## Shift-Left Security Is Essential

NoNonSec champions **shift-left security**, integrating checks early in the
development lifecycle:

- Understand every component in your dependencies before you execute them.
- Require full transparency and verification prior to deployment.
- Identify and resolve security issues when they’re cheapest and easiest to fix.

Shifting left reduces risk and strengthens your security posture.

## Earning Trust

Trust comes only through rigorous verification:

- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**  
  A comprehensive inventory of every component and version in the package.

- **Security Scanning**  
  Automated or manual vulnerability assessments to uncover known flaws.

No SBOM or scan? No trust. No trust? No run.

## Core Principle: No SBOM + No Scan = No Run

If a package lacks both an SBOM and a vulnerability scan, **do not run it**.  
Executing unverified software is an unacceptable security risk.

## Shift-Right Security Complements Shift-Left

Shift-left is vital — but it’s only half the battle. Shift-right ensures
ongoing protection:

- Continuous monitoring of live systems.
- Rapid incident detection and response.
- Regular patching and mitigation workflows.

Security never stops — it’s a continuous, full-lifecycle commitment.

## Usage

For detailed instructions on applying NoNonSec principles, see the
[Usage Guide](docs/usage.md).

## Summary

NoNonSec’s mandate is straightforward:

1. No-nonsense security from day one — don’t wait for breaches.
2. Require SBOMs and vulnerability scans before running any software.
3. Embed shift-left practices early; maintain shift-right vigilance later.
4. Protect your environments with transparency, verification, and continuous
   checks.
5. No excuses, no vague reasons — security applies everywhere.
