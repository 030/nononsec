# NOPSEC — No One Prioritizes SECurity

## Overview

**NOPSEC** states the hard truth:  
**No One Prioritizes SECurity**—until it’s too late.

Only run software if one fully trust it.

Trust is earned, never assumed.

## Shift-Left Security is Essential

NOPSEC pushes for **shift-left security**, embedding checks early in
development. This means:

- Know exactly what is inside every package before running it.
- Demand transparency and verification before deployment.
- Catch security issues early, when cheaper and easier to fix.

Shift-left reduces risk and improves security posture.

## How to Establish Trust?

Trust can only be earned through:

- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**  
  A detailed list of all components and versions in the package.

- **Security Scanning:**  
  Automated or manual scans to find known security flaws.

No SBOM or scan means no trust.

## The Core Rule: No SBOM + No Scan = No Run

Without SBOM and vulnerability scan, **do not run the software.**

Running unverified software is a serious security risk.

Only run what is transparent and verified.

## Shift-Right Security Still Matters

Shift-left is critical but not enough.

Shift-right is also needed for:

- Monitoring live systems.
- Incident detection and response.
- Timely patching and mitigation.

Security is a continuous process.

## Summary

NOPSEC’s message is clear:

- No One Prioritizes SECurity until a breach happens.
- Trust before running software — never assume.
- Require SBOM and vulnerability scans upfront.
- Shift-left helps, but shift-right remains vital.
- Protect environments with transparency and checks.
